            <h2>Salt Lake City</h2>
            <img src="images/slc.jpeg" alt="image of salt lake city" style="width:100px;height:125px;">
            <p> Salt Lake City was founded in 1847 by Mormon settlers led by Brigham Young, who established an extensive irrigation system for the semi-arid valley.
                Temple Square is the City's Origin: The city's compass-based street grid begins at Temple Square, the location of the historic Salt Lake Temple and Mormon Tabernacle.
                High Elevation: The city itself sits at an elevation of about 4,300 feet (1,300 meters) above sea level.
                Home to the Great Salt Lake: The city is named for the massive, highly saline lake to its west, a major natural feature that influences local weather.
                Major Airport: The Salt Lake City International Airport is a significant Western hub for Delta Air Lines and is recognized for its high percentage of on-time flights.
                Genealogy Capital: The Family History Library in Salt Lake City is a world-renowned center for genealogy, housing records of billions of names.
                Access to Skiing: Salt Lake City offers easy access to numerous ski resorts in the Wasatch Mountains, known for abundant snowfall.
                Silicon Slopes: The metropolitan area is a burgeoning tech hub, known as "Silicon Slopes," hosting major tech companies and conferences.
                Rich Cultural Institutions: Unique institutions like the Daughters of Utah Pioneers Museum, with its collection of oddities, showcase the region's history.
                Diverse Population: While a significant portion of Utah's population is Latter-day Saint, less than 40% of Salt Lake City's residents identify as such, contributing to its diverse character. I did not write this list. I found this list on google and am using it as filler content.</p>
